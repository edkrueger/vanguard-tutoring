          <a name="prealgebra"></a> <b>Prealgebra</b><br />
          My general mathematics knowledge allows me to teach Prealgebra in a
          way that imparts understanding, rather than forcing students to
          memorize formulas. I specialize in answering "Why?" Knowing the "Why"
          in mathematics allows students to build upon their knowledge as they
          progress through subsequent levels.<br />

          Courses in Prealgebra ought to equip students with the tools of
          arithmetic so they can be successful in future math courses. My
          general knowledge of mathematics allows me to teach Prealgebra in a
          way that imparts conceptual understanding. Often students struggle in
          Prealgebra because courses are taught with minimal focus on
          explanation. Since explanations are usually nonexistent, many students
          see mathematics as mindless applications of rules. I make mathematics
          tractable by explaining “Why”. Knowing the "Why" in mathematics allows
          students to build upon their knowledge as they progress through
          subsequent levels.<br /><br />

          <a name="algebra"></a><b>Algebra</b><br />
          Courses in Algebra ought to equip students with many of the basic
          tools of mathematical and scientific reasoning. My general knowledge
          of mathematics allows me to teach Algebra in a way that imparts
          conceptual understanding. Often students struggle in Algebra because
          courses are taught with minimal focus on applications and very little
          explanation. Since applications are often ignored and explanations are
          usually nonexistent, many students see mathematics as mindless
          applications of rules. I make mathematics relatable by discussing
          applications. I make mathematics tractable by explaining why. Knowing
          the "Why" in mathematics allows students to build upon their knowledge
          as they progress through subsequent levels.<br /><br />

          <a name="geometry"></a> <b>Geometry</b><br />
          Geometry takes a departure from other high school mathematics courses
          by changing the focus from problem solving to mathematical reasoning.
          Geometry is the first class where students are expected to show the
          soundness of their mathematical reasoning. In mathematics, such
          demonstrations are called proofs. Since mathematics is really about
          answering “Why?, proofs are the essence of the field. Due to my
          training in formal mathematics and my passion for reasoning, I can
          impart an interest and understanding of proofs to the student of
          geometry.<br /><br />

          <a name="trigonometry"></a> <b>Trigonometry </b><br />
          Trigonometry is one of the most conceptually and practically difficult
          subjects in high school mathematics. Trigonometric functions are often
          not well explained and students are simply told to input problems into
          their calculators. This leaves most students with very little
          understanding and motivation. Fortunately, much of Trigonometry can be
          shown using techniques learned in geometry. I make Trigonometry
          tractable by explaining “Why”. Knowing the "Why" in mathematics allows
          students to build upon their knowledge as they progress through
          subsequent levels.

          <a name="precalculus"></a> <b>Precalculus</b><br />
          Precalculus introduces students to the function, the most essential
          element of modern mathematics. It takes a departure from the
          straightforward application of rules found in earlier math courses. A
          good conceptual understanding of functions is essential for success in
          calculus and further studies in mathematics. Due to my passion for
          applied mathematics, Precalculus is one of the most enjoyable courses
          I tutor. My general mathematics knowledge allows me to teach
          Precalculus in a way that imparts conceptual understanding to
          students, rather than forcing students to memorize formulas and
          procedures.<br /><br />

          <a name="calculus"></a> <b>Calculus</b><br />
          Calculus is the most powerful mathematical tool available to
          scientists and analysts. As such, when I tutor Calculus, I put special
          emphasis on its ability to solve applied problems in science and
          business. My general mathematics knowledge allows me to teach Calculus
          in a way that imparts conceptual understanding to students, rather
          than forcing students to memorize formulas. I specialize in answering
          "Why”. Knowing the "Why" in mathematics allows students to build upon
          their knowledge, as they progress through subsequent levels.<br /><br />

          <a name="finitemath"></a> <b>Finite Math</b> <br />
          Finite Math courses cover a variety of topics useful to business,
          humanities and social science students. Typical courses introduce
          students to matrix calculation, linear algebra, linear programing and
          probability theory. Since Finite Math courses cover such a broad
          selection of mathematics, courses are taught with minimal focus on
          applications and very little explanation. This often leaves students
          confused. Since applications are often ignored and explanations are
          usually nonexistent, many students see mathematics as mindless
          applications of rules. I make Finite Math relatable by discussing
          applications. I make it tractable by explaining why.<br /><br />

          <a name="differentialequations"></a> <b>Differential Equations</b
          ><br />
          Differential Equations is a subject of mathematics with many
          applications in the physical sciences, population biology, engineering
          and other fields. My background in evolutionary economics and biology
          allows me to engage students in the subject.<br />

          Although Differential Equations is based on the techniques of
          integration taught in calculus courses, there is no general procedure
          to solve them. This makes Differential Equations a challenging course.
          Different types of Differential Equations require different tools to
          solve them. One common pedagogical approach to Differential Equations
          is to teach students to recognize forms of equations and memorize
          their general solutions. While this technique works for given
          problems, it obscures the thinking behind the subject and requires
          students to memorize instead of learn. This approach is of little use
          in solving other problems. My general mathematics knowledge allows me
          to teach Differential Equations in a way that imparts conceptual
          understanding to students, rather than forcing students to memorize
          solution forms.<br /><br />

          <a name="discretemath"></a> <b>Discrete Math</b><br />
          Discrete Math is most students’ first introduction to formal math. It
          is essentially a course in mathematical logic. As such, most students
          will be familiar with much of the mathematical content of the course,
          but will struggle with the logical formalism that it requires.
          Discrete Math teaches students how to reason mathematically. It
          teaches students to read mathematical statements and to write proofs.
          Rather than teaching problem solving or new mathematical techniques,
          it focuses on how to show the truth of a mathematical statement and
          the logical soundness of a proof. My background in logic, philosophy
          and formal math makes me uniquely qualified to tutor this course.<br /><br />
