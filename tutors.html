            Edward Krueger has been a tutor since the completion of his Masters
            degree in 2014. Hundreds of hours of tutoring experience in
            mathematics, economics, and test preparation have made him a highly
            qualified tutor. With his background in mathematics and the liberal
            arts, he is able to explain challenging mathematical concepts and
            create a foundation of understanding for students who would not
            excel otherwise. <br />
            <br />
            With his vast educational background in mathematics and the social
            sciences, he appeals to the talents and interests of a broad range
            of students. He particularly enjoys teaching those who do not
            typically relate to, or find difficulty in mathematical subjects. He
            empowers the student through a holistic teaching approach, rather
            than merely presenting facts and formulas.<br />

            “My name is Pavel Nitchovski. I am a doctoral student in Philosophy,
            working mainly at the intersection of ethics, meta-ethics, and moral
            psychology. In other words, I'm interested in what constitutes the
            good life, what grounds our reasoning about it, and how we can bring
            it about. Although my primary focus is in the areas described, I
            have graduate level knowledge in all of the major fields of
            philosophy and can offer assistance in any undergraduate philosophy
            course. This applies not only in explaining and elucidating
            philosophical texts, but also, crucially, in helping with
            philosophical writing and, broadly speaking, the construction of any
            argumentative essay. If you need to write something clearly and
            persuasively, I can teach you how to do so.”<br /><br />
